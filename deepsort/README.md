# DeepSORT

## Introduction

This repository contains code for *Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric* (Deep SORT).
We extend the original [SORT](https://github.com/abewley/sort) algorithm to
integrate appearance information based on a deep appearance descriptor.
See the [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402) for more information.

## Dependencies

The code is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3. The following dependencies are
needed to run the tracker:

* NumPy
* sklearn
* OpenCV

Additionally, feature generation requires TensorFlow (>= 1.0).

## Highlevel overview of source files

In the top-level directory are executable scripts to execute, evaluate, and
visualize the tracker. The main entry point is in `deep_sort_app.py`.
This file runs the tracker on a MOTChallenge sequence.

In package `deep_sort` is the main tracking code:

* `detection.py`: Detection base class.
* `kalman_filter.py`: A Kalman filter implementation and concrete parametrization for image space filtering.
* `linear_assignment.py`: Contains code for min cost matching and the matching cascade.
* `iou_matching.py`: Contains the IOU matching metric.
* `nn_matching.py`: A module for a nearest neighbors matching metric.
* `track.py`: The track class contains single-target track data such as Kalman
  state, number of hits, misses, hit streak, associated feature vectors, etc.
* `tracker.py`: The multi-target tracker class.

The `deep_sort_app.py` expects detections in a custom format, stored in .npy
files. These can be computed from MOTChallenge detections using
`generate_detections.py`. We also provide
[pre-generated detections](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VVqtL0klSUvLnmBKS89il1EKC3IxUBVK).
