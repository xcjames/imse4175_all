# Task(1)-2023-10-27
1. Get some videos from higher angles.
2. Do labeling by yourself.
3. Some problems are in these results:  (1)It seldom detects "other vehicles" label, It rarely detect buses, vans, trucks...(even though they have large size in the videos) ;  (2)It seldom detects "bicycles" when a person is riding on it. Instead, it detects the whole object as "person".
4. Learn how to train the YOLO (https://github.com/chenbinluo/Learning_target_detection).
5. Understand details for three python files. Set a template for my own project.

4. Done. Downloaded FLIR dataset. https://adas-dataset-v2.flirconservator.com/#downloadguide, 
5. 

# Task(2)-2023-11-01
1. Need to train the model first(use FLIR dataset, model from the website, probably try to use YOLOv8?)
2. Labeling: if result not accurate, do labeling of the dataset.
3. speed should also be considered! Read some papers to tackle this! opencv(is there a function that can use speed as a feature? )
4. Overall,ultimate goal is to use thermal camera, need to compare CCTV baseline with thermal.
